Inter-Process Communication (IPC)
The lecture starts by explaining the need for Inter-Process Communication (IPC). While processes are designed to be isolated to prevent them from interfering with each other, this isolation also makes communication challenging. The course explains that a simple solution like sharing files is inefficient due to the slowness of disk I/O. Instead, the lecture introduces a more efficient method: an in-memory queue managed by the kernel. This method uses the same POSIX interface for reading and writing as files, making it a familiar and powerful tool.

Pipes
Pipes are presented as the primary mechanism for IPC on a single machine. Here's a breakdown of their key features:

Creation: A pipe is created using the pipe(int filedes[2]) syscall, which allocates two new file descriptors.

Functionality: One file descriptor (fd[1]) is for writing, and the other (fd[0]) is for reading. Data flows in one direction, like a real-world pipe.

Implementation: Pipes are implemented as a fixed-size queue in memory.

Blocking: If a process tries to write to a full pipe, it will be put to sleep until space becomes available. Similarly, if a process tries to read from an empty pipe, it will block until data is available.

End-of-File (EOF): When the last "write" descriptor is closed, the pipe is effectively closed, and subsequent reads will return an EOF. If the last "read" descriptor is closed, any further writes will generate a SIGPIPE signal.

Sockets
The lecture then extends the concept of IPC to network communication using sockets. Sockets are an abstraction of a network I/O queue and provide an endpoint for communication. They allow processes on different machines to communicate as if they were on the same machine.

Socket Abstraction: A socket is an endpoint for communication, providing a queue to hold data temporarily. It uses the same read/write interface as files, making it easy to use for network I/O.

Communication: A network connection consists of a pair of sockets connected to each other.

Client-Server Model: The lecture uses the client-server model to illustrate how sockets work. A client opens a socket to connect to a server. The client can then write to the socket to send requests and read from it to receive responses. The server listens for incoming connections and creates a new socket for each unique connection.

Connection Setup: The lecture briefly touches on the 3-way handshake used by TCP/IP to establish a reliable connection.

Concurrency: To handle multiple requests concurrently, a server can create a new process or a new thread for each request. The lecture discusses the trade-offs between these two approaches, highlighting that threads are more lightweight but offer less isolation.

Thread Pools: To avoid the overhead of creating too many threads, a thread pool can be used. A thread pool maintains a fixed number of threads that are ready to serve requests from a queue. This approach limits the number of concurrent threads and prevents a spike in traffic from overwhelming the server.

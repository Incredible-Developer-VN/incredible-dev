**Synchronization: Concurrency and Mutual Exclusion**.

## Core Theory: Synchronization, Concurrency, and Mutual Exclusion

At its heart, this topic is about managing chaos. In modern operating systems, many things are happening at once, or at least appear to be. This is **concurrency**. Processes and threads execute simultaneously, sharing resources like memory, files, and peripherals.

### The Problem: Race Conditions

When multiple threads or processes access and manipulate shared data concurrently, the final outcome can depend on the specific order in which their instructions are executed. This is a **race condition**. The result becomes unpredictable and often incorrect.

Imagine two threads trying to increment a shared counter variable `X` (initially 0).

  * **Thread 1:** `read X`, `increment X`, `write X`
  * **Thread 2:** `read X`, `increment X`, `write X`

If they run one after the other, `X` will correctly be 2. But what if their operations interleave?

1.  **Thread 1** reads `X` (gets 0).
2.  **Thread 2** reads `X` (gets 0).
3.  **Thread 1** increments its local value to 1 and writes it back. `X` is now 1.
4.  **Thread 2** increments its local value to 1 and writes it back. `X` is now 1.

The final result is 1, which is wrong. We lost an increment. This is the classic race condition problem.

### The Solution: Critical Sections and Mutual Exclusion

The part of the code that accesses the shared resource (like the counter `X`) is called the **critical section**. To prevent race conditions, we must ensure that when one thread is executing in its critical section, no other thread is allowed to execute in its critical section.

This property is called **mutual exclusion**. It's the primary goal of synchronization. To achieve it, we need mechanisms that allow threads to coordinate and wait for each other.

### Mechanisms for Mutual Exclusion

Operating systems and programming languages provide several tools to enforce mutual exclusion:

1.  **Locks (Mutexes):** The simplest synchronization primitive. A lock has two states: **locked** and **unlocked**. Before entering a critical section, a thread tries to `acquire()` the lock.

      * If the lock is unlocked, the thread acquires it, enters the critical section, and then `release()`s the lock when it's done.
      * If the lock is already locked by another thread, the calling thread will **block** (or spin, in the case of a spinlock) until the lock is released. A `mutex` is a type of lock that ensures mutual exclusion.

2.  **Semaphores:** A more general synchronization tool. A semaphore is an integer counter that supports two atomic operations:

      * `P()` or `wait()` or `down()`: Decrements the semaphore value. If the value becomes negative, the thread blocks until it's positive again.
      * `V()` or `signal()` or `up()`: Increments the semaphore value, potentially waking up a blocked thread.
      * **Binary Semaphore:** When the counter is initialized to 1, it functions exactly like a mutex.
      * **Counting Semaphore:** The counter can be initialized to any value `N`, allowing up to `N` threads to access a resource concurrently. This is useful for managing a pool of resources.

3.  **Monitors and Condition Variables:** These are higher-level synchronization constructs designed to be easier and safer to use than locks and semaphores.

      * A **monitor** is a programming language construct that encapsulates shared data and the procedures that operate on it. It automatically enforces mutual exclusion; only one thread can be active inside the monitor's procedures at any given time.
      * **Condition Variables (CVs)** are used within monitors to handle more complex coordination. A CV allows a thread to wait for a specific condition to become true. It supports two main operations:
          * `wait()`: Atomically releases the monitor lock and puts the thread to sleep.
          * `signal()` or `notify()`: Wakes up one thread that is waiting on this condition variable.
          * `broadcast()` or `notifyAll()`: Wakes up all threads waiting on this condition variable.

When a thread is awakened by a `signal()`, it must re-acquire the monitor lock before it can proceed. Crucially, when a thread wakes up from a `wait()`, it must **re-check the condition** it was waiting for. This is because another thread might have run and changed the state, or the `signal()` might have been for a different reason (this is called a "spurious wakeup"). This is why CV waits are almost always in a `while` loop: `while (!condition) { cv.wait(); }`.

## 1.1 What is the Internet?
---

### 🌐 The Internet: A Definition

The **Internet** is a **global computer network** that interconnects millions of **end systems (hosts)**, such as smartphones, laptops, desktops, and servers. These end systems are located at the **edge of the network** and communicate by exchanging **packets** of data.

From a **service perspective**, the Internet provides **infrastructure** that enables applications (such as web browsing, email, file transfers, and video streaming) to **communicate and exchange data**.

> The Internet is sometimes described as a "network of networks" — a complex hierarchy of interconnected networks operated by various organizations and Internet Service Providers (ISPs).

---

### 📦 Packet Switching and Messages

To send data, the source end system breaks the message into **smaller chunks called packets**. Each packet is transmitted through the network and **individually routed** to the destination.

* Packets may **take different routes**.
* The destination **reassembles** them into the original message.

This **packet-switched** architecture enables efficient resource sharing and scalability.

---

### 🕸️ The Network Core

The **core of the Internet** consists of **packet switches**, mainly:

* **Routers**: Forward packets between networks.
* **Link-layer switches**: Operate within a single network segment (e.g., Ethernet LAN).

These switches are responsible for **forwarding packets** from input links to output links. The process of forwarding and path selection is called **routing**.

There are two fundamental methods for sending data:

| Switching Method  | Description                                            |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Circuit Switching | Dedicated path established; used in telephone networks |
| Packet Switching  | Data divided into packets; used in the Internet        |

---

### 🖥️ End Systems (Hosts)

End systems are connected to the Internet through **Access Networks** and **ISPs**. Examples:

* Home networks
* University networks
* Enterprise networks
* Mobile cellular networks

End systems are typically categorized as:

* **Clients**: Request services (e.g., browsers, apps)
* **Servers**: Provide services (e.g., web servers, mail servers)

In **Client-Server Architecture**, clients communicate with centralized servers.
In **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**, end systems communicate **directly**, without fixed servers.

---

### ⚙️ Protocols: The Internet’s Language

A **protocol** defines the **rules for communication** between networked devices. Protocols specify:

* **Message format**
* **Order of message exchange**
* **Actions upon message receipt or errors**

Examples:

* **HTTP** (web browsing)
* **SMTP** (email)
* **TCP/IP** (data transport and addressing)
* **DNS** (domain name resolution)

All communication on the Internet is governed by **protocols**, often organized into **layers**.

---

### 📚 Internet Protocol Stack

The Internet stack consists of **5 layers** (bottom-up view):

1. **Physical Layer** – Moves individual bits over a link (e.g., cables, radio signals)
2. **Link Layer** – Transfers frames between directly connected hosts (e.g., Ethernet, WiFi)
3. **Network Layer** – Handles logical addressing and routing (e.g., IP)
4. **Transport Layer** – Provides end-to-end communication (e.g., TCP, UDP)
5. **Application Layer** – Supports network applications (e.g., HTTP, FTP, SMTP)

Each layer relies on the service of the layer below it and provides a service to the layer above.

---

### 🧠 ISPs and the Internet Infrastructure

The **global Internet** is composed of thousands of **Interconnected ISPs**, forming a hierarchy:

* **Tier 1 ISPs**: Connect globally; very few exist
* **Tier 2 ISPs**: Regional; connect to Tier 1 and smaller ISPs
* **Tier 3 ISPs**: Local; often connect end users

ISPs are **businesses**, and they pay each other to carry traffic, creating a complex web of **peering agreements** and **transit contracts**.

### 📈 Services Provided by the Internet

Different applications require different services. The Internet can provide:

| Service Type               | Description                                                  |
| -------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Reliable data transfer** | Ensures data is delivered correctly and in order (e.g., TCP) |
| **Best-effort delivery**   | No guarantees (e.g., UDP)                                    |
| **Throughput guarantees**  | Some apps need high-speed data (e.g., video calls)           |
| **Latency constraints**    | Delay-sensitive apps (e.g., gaming, VoIP)                    |

The Internet offers **no built-in guarantees**; it's the responsibility of the **application or transport layer protocols** to provide required features.

---

### 📄 Standards and Governance

The Internet is governed by **open standards** maintained by organizations like the:

* **IETF (Internet Engineering Task Force)** – publishes **RFCs (Request For Comments)** that define protocols and standards.
* **ICANN, IANA** – handle IP address assignment and domain naming.

> Internet protocols are **not patented**; they are open and publicly documented, enabling innovation and interoperability.

---

### ✅ Final Thoughts

The Internet is:

* A **massively distributed, packet-switched network** of networks
* Governed by **protocols and layered architectures**
* Supporting billions of **devices and users**
* Continuously evolving to support new applications and scale demands

Understanding this foundation sets the stage for diving deeper into each layer of the Internet protocol stack.

## 1.2 The Network Edge

### 🌐 What is the Network Edge?

The **network edge** refers to the **outermost part of the Internet**, where **end systems (hosts)** are located. These are the devices that **generate and consume data**, such as:

- Laptops
- Smartphones
- PCs
- Servers

These devices communicate over the Internet using **application-layer protocols** like HTTP, FTP, SMTP, etc.

---

### 🧑‍💻 End Systems: Clients and Servers

End systems interact using one of two architectural models:

#### 1. **Client-Server Architecture**

- A **client** requests services.
- A **server** provides services.
- The server is always **on and reachable**.
- Example: a browser (client) requesting a webpage from a web server.

#### 2. **Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture**

- No dedicated server.
- Peers (hosts) act as **both clients and servers**.
- Example: BitTorrent file sharing.
- Advantages: scalability, resource sharing
- Challenges: security, reliability

### 📶 Access Networks

Access networks connect **end systems to the first router** (also known as the edge router) in the Internet. These are the entry points to the global Internet.

#### Common access network technologies:

| Type                  | Examples            | Description                |
| --------------------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **Residential**       | DSL, Cable, FTTH    | Common for homes           |
| **Mobile**            | 4G, 5G              | Wireless cellular networks |
| **Enterprise**        | Ethernet LAN        | High-speed, wired access   |
| **Campus/University** | Ethernet LAN, Wi-Fi | Local network access       |

---

### ⚙️ Physical Media (Transmission Medium)

Data travels through the Internet via **physical transmission media**, which can be:

#### 1. **Guided Media** (signals follow a physical path):

- Twisted-pair copper wires (used in Ethernet and DSL)
- Coaxial cable (used in cable networks)
- Optical fiber (very high-speed data transmission)

#### 2. **Unguided Media** (wireless transmission):

- Radio (Wi-Fi, 4G, 5G)
- Microwave
- Satellite communication
- Infrared

### 📊 Performance Metrics

Network performance between end systems and the edge is determined by several key metrics:

| Metric                     | Description                                                                        |
| -------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Bandwidth (Throughput)** | Rate of data transfer (bits per second)                                            |
| **Latency (Delay)**        | Time it takes for data to travel from source to destination                        |
| **Packet Loss**            | Percentage of packets lost in transmission                                         |
| **Jitter**                 | Variation in packet delay – important for real-time apps like voice or video calls |
